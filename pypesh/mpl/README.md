Here we utilise different adjustmenst to MatPlotLib in order to make better plots.

<h1>streamplot_many_arrows.py</h1>
Unpublished on PyPyi version of matplotlib added to make small_particles_encounters.

Copied from the version from pull request: Add new num_arrows option to streamplot #27617.

Allows to draw streamline with multiple arrows

<h1>fenix_arrow.py</h1>

Better style (in our opinion) of 'fancy' style from FancyArrowPatch

<h1>curved_text.py</h1>

Class to make text curved along the selected curve thanks to the curtesy of Thomas KÃ¼hn from Stack Overflow issue: Curved text rendering in matplotlib. Fixed a bit to be compatible with latex expressions like $a$.
